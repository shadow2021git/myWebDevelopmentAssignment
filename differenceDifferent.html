<h1> Different between different programming Languages </h1>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> C++ language</h3>
<p>The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program.</p>
<p> The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times. This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree </p>
</div>

<h3> C Language </h3>
<p>The C language is a basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster. However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language. </p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> Pascal Language </h3>
<p>Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language. So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently Borland compilers only use it. </p>

<h3> Fortran Language </h3>
<p>Fortran language is a number crunching language and still it is used by scientists. This language allows different sizes of variables up to the memory limit in the machine. This language is suitable for engineers, who have to calculate values with high precision. Program in Fortran is inflexible and sometimes it makes difficult to read. </p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> Java Language </h3>
<p> The Java language is a multi-platform language thatâ€™s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax.</p>
<p> For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.</p>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> Perl Language </h3>
<p>Perl language is a file management language for UNIX. But it is more popular for its common gateway interface programming (CGI). It is a term for programs that web servers can perform to allow additional capabilities of web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals if you have any experience in any language. </p> <p>As a CGI language, web hosting services select Perl
language over C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled. </p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> PHP Language </h3>
<p>The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has more sophisticated object oriented features.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">

<h3> Python Language </h3>
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p><p> Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
