<h1> Real-World applications of C++ </h1>
<div class="beauty">
<h3> Games</h3>
<p>C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU intensive functions and is fast. It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking. All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop the gaming systems as well as game development suites.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> GUI based applications</h3>
<p>C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI based and desktop applications easily as it has got the required features.</p>
<p>Most of the applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator, Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++.</p>
<p>Win amp media player from Microsoft is a popular software that has been catering to all our audio/video needs for decades now. This software is developed in C++.</p>

</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3> Database Software</h3>
<p>C++ is also used in writing database management software. The two most popular databases MySQL and Postgres are written in C++.</p>
<p>MySQL, one of the most popular database software that is used widely in many real-world applications is written in C++.</p>
<p>This is the world’s most popular open-source database. This database is written in C++ and is used by most of the organizations.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Operating Systems</h3>
<p>The fact that C++ is a strongly typed and fast programming language makes it an ideal candidate for writing operating systems. In addition to this, C++ has a wide collection of system-level functions that also help in writing low-level programs.</p>
<p>Apple OS X has some of its parts written in C++. Similarly, some parts of the iPod are also written in C++.</p>
<p>Most of the software from Microsoft is developed using C++ (flavors of Visual C++). Applications like Windows 95, ME, 98; XP, etc. are written in C++. Apart from this, the IDE Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office are also written in C++.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Browsers</h3>
<p>Browsers are mostly used in C++ for rendering purposes. Rendering engines need to be faster in execution as most people do not like to wait for the web page to be loaded. With the fast performance of C++, most browsers have their rendering software written in C++.</p>
<p>Mozilla internet browser Firefox is an open-source project and is developed completely in C++.</p>
<p>Just like the Firefox browser, the email client from Mozilla, Thunderbird is also developed in C++. This is also an open-source project.</p>
<p>Google applications like Google File System and Chrome browser are written in C++.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Advanced Computation And Graphics</h3>
<p>C++ is useful in developing an application that requires high-performance image processing, real-time physical simulations, and mobile sensor applications that need high performance and speed.</p>
<p>Maya 3D software from Alias system is developed in C++ and is used for animation, virtual reality, 3D graphics, and environments.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Banking Applications</h3>
<p>As C++ aids in concurrency, it becomes the default choice for banking applications that require multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance.</p>
<p>Infosys Finacle – is a popular core banking application that uses C++ as backend programming languages.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Cloud/Distributed System</h3>
<p>Cloud storage systems that are extensively used nowadays work close to the hardware. C++ becomes a default choice for implementing such systems as it is close to the hardware. C++ also provides multithreading support that can build concurrent applications and load tolerance.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is a distributed RDBMS application that is used for accurately providing real-time financial information and news to investors.</p>
<p>While Bloomberg’s RDBMS is written in C, its development environment and set of libraries are written in C++. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Compilers</h3>
<p>Compilers of various high-level programming languages are written either in C or C++. The reason is that both C and C++ are low-level languages that are close to hardware and are able to program and manipulate the underlying hardware resources.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
<p>Various embedded systems like smartwatches, medical equipment systems use C++ to program as it is closer to the hardware level and can provide a lot of low-level function calls when compared to the other high-level programming languages.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Enterprise Software</h3>
<p>C++ is used in developing many enterprise software as well as advanced applications like flight simulation and radar processing.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>When we require very high-level mathematical computations, performance and speed become important. Hence most of the libraries use C++ as their core programming language. Most high-level machine language libraries use C++ as backend.</p>
<p>C++ is faster than most of the other programming languages and also supports multithreading with concurrency. Thus in Applications where the speed along with concurrency is required, C++ is the most sought-after language for development. </p>
