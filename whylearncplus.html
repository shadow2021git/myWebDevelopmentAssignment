<ul type="disc">
	<li>C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development. </li> 
	<li>C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification. </li> 
	<li>C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work. </li>
