<h1> Features of C++ </h1>
<div class="beauty">
<h3> Object Oriented Programming Language</h3>
<p>The main upgradation from C to C++ is object-oriented programming. It follows concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction. This makes development and maintenance easier.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly understand the concepts of object-oriented programming. </p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Class:</b> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. </li>
	<li><b> Object:</B> It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. A C++ program creates many objects which interact by invoking methods.</li>
	<li><b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently. </li>
	<li><b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. </li>
	<li><b>Encapsulation:</b> Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. </li>
	<li><b>Abstraction:</b> Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. </li>
	
</ul>

<h3> Simple</h3>
<p> C++ provides a structured approach wherein you can break the problem into parts and design the solution modularly. It provides you a rich set of library functions that you can use while implementing the solution. If you have worked with C language, then moving to C++ would be a very smooth transitioning. The syntax is almost similar with minute changes.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Structured programming language</h3>
<p>In C++ programming, the code is modular with the help of functions, classes & objects, and the modules are loosely coupled. Modular code is easy to understand & modify. This makes C++ a structured programming language. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Rich Library </h3>
<p>Developers have access to lots of in-built functions provided by C++ language. This saves time & makes development fast. Let’s look at some of the C++ header files & functionalities provided by it.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>iostream :</b>Contains C++ standard input and output functions </li>
	<li><b>iomanip :</b>Contains stream manipulators that format streams of data </li>
	<li><b>cmath :</b>Contains math library functions </li>
	<li><b>fstream :</b>Contains function for functions that perform input from files on disk and output to files on disk </li>
	<li><b>ctime :</b>Contains function for manipulating the time and date </li>
	<li><b>memory :</b>Contains classes and functions used by the C++ Standard Library to allocate memory to the C++ Standard Library containers </li>
	<li><b>iterator :</b>Contains classes for accessing data in the C++ Standard Library containers </li>
	<li><b>algorithm : </b>Contains functions for manipulating data in C++ Standard Library containers </li>

</div>



<div class="beauty">
<h3> Memory management</h3>
<p>C++ supports dynamic memory allocation. You can free the allocated memory at any time. Not only this C++ also provides dynamic memory management techniques. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Powerful & Fast</h3>
<p>C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a wide variety of data types, functions & operators. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Pointers</h3>
<p>Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. Pointer points to the memory location of a variable. C++ supports pointer and provides solutions to lots of problems that demand access to memory location. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Compiler based</h3>
<p>C++ is a compiler-based programming language. Without compilation, no C++ program can be executed. The compiler first compiles the C++ program and then it is executed. </p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Syntax based language</h3>
<p>C++ is a language that complies strongly with syntax. Language following rules and regulations very strictly is known as tight syntax-based language. C, C++, Java, .net are some of the examples. </p>
