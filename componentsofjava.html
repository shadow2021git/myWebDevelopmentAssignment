<h1> Components of Java</h1>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</h3>
<p>It is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides a run-time environment in which the bytecode can be executed. It follows three notations: </p>
<p>Specification: It is a document that describes the implementation of the JVM. It is provided by Sun and other companies.
Implementation: It is a program that meets the requirements of JVM specification.
Runtime Instance: An instance of JVM is created whenever you write a command on the command prompt and run the class. </p>
</div>

<h3>
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</h3>
<p>JRE refers to a runtime environment in which bytecode can be executed. It implements the JVM and provides all the class libraries and other support files that JVM uses at runtime. So JRE is a software package that contains what is required to run a program. Basically, itâ€™s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>JDK(Java Development Kit)</h3>
<p><b>It is the tool necessary to:- </b></p>
	<ul type="disc">
	<li>Compile </li>
	<li>Document </li>
	<li>Package Java programs. </li>
	</ul>
<p>The JDK completely includes JRE which contains tools for programmers. The Development Kit is provided free of charge. Along with JRE, it includes an interpreter/loader, a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator and other tools needed in Java development. In short, it contains JRE + development tools. </p>
