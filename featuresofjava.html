<h1> Features of Java</h1>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Simple </h3> 

<p>Java has made life easier by removing all the complexities such as pointers, operator overloading as you see in C++ or any other programming language.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Portable </h3> 

<p>This is platform independent which means that any application written on one platform can be easily ported to another platform.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Object-Oriented </h3> 

<p>Everything is considered to be an “object” which possess some state, behavior and all the operations are performed using these objects.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Secured </h3> 

<p>All the code is converted in bytecode after compilation, which is not readable by a human. and java does not use an explicit pointer and run the programs inside the sandbox to prevent any activities from untrusted sources. It enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems/applications.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Dynamic </h3> 

<p>It has the ability to adapt to an evolving environment which supports dynamic memory allocation due to which memory wastage is reduced and performance of the application is increased.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Distributed </h3> 

<p>This language provides a feature which helps to create distributed applications. Using Remote Method Invocation (RMI), a program can invoke a method of another program across a network and get the output. You can access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Robust </h3> 

<p>Java has a strong memory management system. It helps in eliminating error as it checks the code during compile and runtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>High Performance </h3> 

<p>Java achieves high performance through the use of bytecode which can be easily translated into native machine code. With the use of JIT (Just-In-Time) compilers, it enables high performance.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Interpreted </h3> 

<p>Java is compiled to bytecodes, which are interpreted by a run-time environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3>Multithreaded </h3> 

<p>Java supports multiple threads of execution (a.k.a., lightweight processes), including a set of synchronization primitives. This makes programming with threads much easier.</p>
