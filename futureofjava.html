<h1> Future of Java</h1>
<div class="beauty">
<p>Java has and will continue to have a very good future. Software that solves specific purposes like ERP, CRMs, cloud internal software, Orchestration frameworks, IDMs, etc, have been built using Java. Since this has taken years to build them they will continue to use them now and in the future. </p>
<p>Java has a Java virtual machine, which is used by other technologies such as Kotlin and Scala. Moreover, developers can write the same code that will function on various OS (operating systems) like Linux and Microsoft Windows. Among other reasons why Java won’t fade away soon, we can state the following: </p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>It’s an excellent choice for creating streaming apps thanks to its reactive function. </li>
	<li>Java is still used in web, mobile development, big data, IoT (Internet of Things), blockchain, and artificial intelligence. </li>
	<li>It’s possible to develop FaaS (function as a service) and serverless apps with a robust functionality. </li>
	<li> Java keeps pace with the progress and updates its versions faster than several years ago. For instance, Java 15 was released just in 6 months after Java 14. In the previous versions like Java 8-13, it took up to 5-6 years.</li>
	<li>AirBnb, Uber, Netflix, and other tech giants are still implementing Java in their development processes. </li>
</ul>
