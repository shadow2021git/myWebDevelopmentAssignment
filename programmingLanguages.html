<h1> Programming Languages </h1>

<h3> What is a Programming Language ? </h3>
<p> For computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other similar electronic devices to work, a programming language is necessary that tells them the commands and allows them to complete different activities. There are several types and features of programming languages depending on their philosophy and objectives.</p> 

<p> A programming language consists of a vocabulary containing a set of grammatical rules intended to convey instructions to a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.
Each programming language has a unique set of keywords along with a special syntax to organize the software’s instructions. </p>

<p> There are low-level and high-level programming languages which, although simple compared to human languages, are more complex than machine languages.</p>

<h3>Low level languages</h3>

<p> Low level languages are used to write programs that relate to the specific architecture and hardware of a particular type of computer. They are closer to the native language of a computer (binary), making them harder for programmers to understand.</p>
 
<h4> Examples of low level language: </h4>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Assembly Language </li>
	<li> Machine Code</li>
</ul>

<h4> Assembly Language </h4>
<p> Few programmers write programs in low level assembly language, but it is still used for developing code for specialist hardware, such as device drivers.
It is easy distinguishable from a high level language as it contains few recognisable human words but plenty of mnemonic code.</p>

<h4> Advantages </h4>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Can make use of special hardware or special machine-dependent instructions (e.g. on the specific chip) </li>
	<li>Translated program requires less memory </li>
	<li>Write code that can be executed faster </li>
	<li>Total control over the code</li>
	<li>Can work directly on memory locations </li>
</ul>

<h3>High level languages</h3>
<p>When we think about computer programmers, we are probably thinking about people who write in high-level programming languages.</p>
<p> High level languages are written in a form that is close to our human language, enabling to programmer to just focus on the problem being solved.</p>
<p>No particular knowledge of the hardware is needed as high level languages create programs that are portable and not tied to a particular computer or microchip. These programmer friendly languages are called ‘high level’ as they are far removed from the machine code instructions understood by the computer.</p>

<p>Examples include: C++, Java, Pascal, Python, Visual Basic. </p>
