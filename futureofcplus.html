<h1> What is the future of C++ ?</h1>
<div class="beauty">
<p>The beauty of C++ is that if you understand it, you should be able to switch to any new programming language with less effort.</p>
<p>When learning C++, you are learning some of the core concepts of programming.</p>
<p>Here is a nice discussion on what will happen to C/C++ in the next ten years. Few years ago, C++ 17 was introduced with lots of new and interesting features and new C++20 version is almost ready. So, the language is constantly evolving with time and adding modern features for example Three-way Comparison.</p>
<p>The four-standout features of C++ 20 that were initially perceived in “The Design and Evolution of C++” back in 1994 are 1) Modules, 2) Ranges, 3) Coroutines and 4)Concepts. These features will simplify the use of C++ further.</p>
<p>C++ is still successful in areas where real time performance, micro memory management, large-complex applications and embedded systems are being developed.</p>
<p>Writing games and simulations in C++ alone assures its existence for a very long time to come.</p>
<p>One way to calculate developer demand is to analyze job postings data. C++ is still the fourth most popular programming language among employers as well.</p>
<p>In conclusion, C++ will continue to remain popular and in high demand owing to its performance, reliability, and the wide variety of contexts in which it can be used.</p>
