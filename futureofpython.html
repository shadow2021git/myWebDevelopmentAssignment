<h1> What is the future of Python ?</h1>

<div class="beauty">
<p>
The future scope of python programming language can also be predicted by the way it has helped big data technology to grow. Python has been successfully contributing in analyzing a large number of data sets across computer clusters through its high-performance toolkits and libraries. </p>
<p>
Python will be the language of the future.... Python programming language is better used for app development, web app or web development, game development, scientific computing, system administration, etc. There are several traits of this programming tool which has provided it with an incredibly successful journey  </p>
<p>
Python 2 has been one of the world's most popular programming languages since 2000, but its death – strictly speaking, at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day 2020 – has been widely announced on technology news sites around the world. But Python isn't dead, because Python 3 has been around since the late 2000s.  </p>
<p>Longer term there's no way to know for sure with any language, but it's not really worth worrying about because IF Python is ever supplanted by a newer shinier language, it's almost guaranteed that most of the things you learn in Python will transfer easily to the new language.

When you're learning Python (or any language) the specifics of the language is not where most of your effort will be spent anyway. Instead you'll learn a lot of general principles, and those apply no matter what language you'll use for implementing them a few decades from now.  </p>
