<h1> Why is python so popular ?</h1>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>Easy to Learn and Use  </h3>
<p>Python language is incredibly easy to use and learn for new beginners and newcomers. The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has
simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages. </p>
<p>When Guido van Rossum was creating python in the 1980s, he made sure to design it to be a general-purpose language. One of the main reasons for the popularity of python would be its simplicity in syntax so that it could be easily read and understood even by amateur developers also. </p>
<p>One can also quickly experiment by changing the code base of python because it is an interpreted language which makes it even more popular among all kinds of developers. </p>
</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>Mature and Supportive Python Community  </h3>
<p>Python was created more than 30 years ago, which is a lot of time for any community of programming language to grow and mature adequately to support developers ranging from beginner to expert levels. There are plenty of documentation, guides and Video Tutorials for Python language are available that learner and developer of any skill level or ages can use and receive the support required to enhance their knowledge in python programming language. </p>
<p>Many students get introduced to computer science only through Python language, which is the same language used for in-depth research projects. </p>
<p>If any programming language lacks developer support or documentation, then they don’t grow much. But python has no such kind of problems because it has been here for a very long time. The python developer community is one of the most incredibly active programming language communities. </p>
<p>This means that if somebody has an issue with python language, they can get instant support from developers of all levels ranging from beginner to expert in the community. Getting help on time plays a vital role in the development of the project, which otherwise might cause delays. </p>

<h3>Support from Renowned Corporate Sponsors  </h3>
<p>Programming languages grows faster when a corporate sponsor backs it. For example, PHP is backed by Facebook, Java by Oracle and Sun, Visual Basic & C# by Microsoft. Python Programming language is heavily backed by Facebook, Amazon Web Services, and especially Google. </p>
<p>Google adopted python language way back in 2006 and have used it for many applications and platforms since then. Lots of Institutional effort and money have been devoted to the training and success of the python language by Google. They have even created a dedicated portal only for python. The list of support tools and documentation keeps on growing for python language in the developers’ world. </p>
</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>Hundreds of Python Libraries and Frameworks  </h3>
<p>Due to its corporate sponsorship and big supportive community of python, python has excellent libraries that you can use to select and save your time and effort on the initial cycle of development. There are also lots of cloud media services that offer cross-platform support through library-like tools, which can be extremely beneficial. </p>
<p>Libraries with specific focus are also available like nltk for natural language processing or scikit-learn for machine learning applications. </p>
<p>There are many frameworks and libraries are available for python language, such as: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>matplotib for plotting charts and graphs </li>
	<li>SciPy for engineering applications, science, and mathematics </li>
	<li>BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and XML </li>
	<li>NumPy for scientific computing </li>
	<li>Django for server-side web development </li>
</ul>

<h3>Versatility, Efficiency, Reliability, and Speed  </h3>
<p>Ask any python developer, and they will wholeheartedly agree that the python language is efficient, reliable, and much faster than most modern languages. Python can be used in nearly any kind of environment, and one will not face any kind of performance loss issue irrespective of the platform one is working.</p>
<p>One more best thing about versatility of python language is that it can be used in many varieties of environments such as mobile applications, desktop applications, web development, hardware programming, and many more. The versatility of python makes it more attractive to use due to its high number of applications.</p>

<h3>Big data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing  </h3>
<p>Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Big Data are some of the hottest trends in the computer science world right now, which helps lots of organizations to transform and improve their processes and workflows.</p>
<p>Python language is the second most popular used tool after R language for data science and analytics. Lots of many data processing workloads in the organization are powered by python language only. Most of the research and development takes place in python language due to its many applications, including ease of analyzing and organizing the usable data.</p>
<p>Not only this, but hundreds of python libraries are being used in thousands of machine learning projects every day, such as TensorFlow for neural networks and OpenCV for computer vision, etc. </p>
</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>First-choice Language  </h3>
<p> Python language is the first choice for many programmers and students due to the main reason for python being in high demand in the development market. Students and developers always look forward to learning a language that is in high demand. Python is undoubtedly the hottest cake in the market now.</p>
<p>Many programmers and data science students are using python language for their development projects. Learning python is one of the important section in data science certification courses. In this way, the python language can provide plenty of fantastic career opportunities for students. Due to the variety of applications of python, one can pursue different career options and will not remain stuck to one. </p>

<h3>The Flexibility of Python Language  </h3>
<p>The python language is so flexible that it gives the developer the chance to try something new. The person who is an expert in python language is not just limited to build similar kinds of things but can also go on to try to make something different than before. </p>
<p>Python doesn’t restrict developers from developing any sort of application. This kind of freedom and flexibility by just learning one language is not available in other programming languages. </p>
</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>Use of python in academics  </h3>
<p>Now python language is being treated as the core programming language in schools and colleges due to its countless uses in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Data Science, etc. It has now become a fundamental part of the development world that schools and colleges cannot afford not to teach python language.  </p>
<p>In this way, it is increasing more python Developers and Programmers and thus further expanding its growth and popularity. </p>
</div>


<div class="beauty">
<h3>Automation  </h3>
<p>Python language can help a lot in automation of tasks as there are lots of tools and modules available, which makes things much more comfortable. It is incredible to know that one can reach an advanced level of automation easily by just using necessary python codes.  </p>
<p>Python is the best performance booster in the automation of software testing also. One will be amazed at how much less time and few numbers of lines are required to write codes for automation tools.  </p>
