<h1> Are C/C++ still relevant in 2021? </h1>
<div class="beauty">
<h3> Is C++ less popular now?</h3>
<p>According to StackOverFlow Developer Survey Results, C and C++ both are in the top 11 “Most Popular Technologies” under Programming, Scripting, and Markup Languages category.</p>
<p>Similarly, the “Very Long Term History” of programming language popularity in Tiobe Index, shows that C has always been at first two positions since 1985 whereas C++ has always been in top five positions. </p>
<p>As per another industry analyst firm RedMonk, both C and C++ are in top 10 programming languages in January 2021. </p>
<p>According to PYPL Popularity of Programming Language Index, which is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google, shows that C/C++ at number SIX in Worldwide March 2020 index. </p>
<p> Finally, GitHub statistics shows that both C and C++ are the best programming languages to use in 2020 as they are still in the top ten list.</p>
<p><b>So answer is NO. C++ is still one of the most popular programming languages around.</b></p>

<h3> What is the main purpose of C++ today?</h3>
<p>Many C and C++ projects that exist today were started decades ago.</p>
<p>For example, UNIX operating system was rewritten in C in 1972. Oracle database was re-written in 1983 from Assembly into C. Similarly, development of Linux kernel in 1991, and it is also written in C.</p>
<p>Therefore, one purpose of C/C++ being used today is to maintain decades old code and there is no way it can be replaced with another programming language in the near future.</p>
<p>The Programming Languages Beacon pinpoints applications, which are still being actively developed in C/C++ or major portion of them. For example, most of Microsoft flagship products are written in C++ (and C, like the Windows kernel).</p>
<p>C++ can be thought of as the dark matter of the developer universe: there is so much of it all around us, hiding in the computational shadows, powering so much of what we take for granted, technologically.</p>
<p>C++ is still being used to develop Desktop based applications, Games and Gaming Engines, 2D and 3D animations, Developing Web Browsers, Database Software, Media Access Software, Compilers, Operating Systems, Printing and Scanning Applications, Engineering and Medical Applications, Embedded and Real-time Applications.</p>

<h3> Is C++ becoming a legacy language like FORTRAN and COBOL?</h3>
<p>C/C++ is still powering the world despite number of new high level programming languages. Most of the major software applications including Adobe, Google, Mozilla, Oracle are all written in C/C++.</p>
<p>Similarly, most of the Microsoft software are developed using various flavors of Visual C++ or simply C++. Few parts of Apple OS X are written in C and Symbian Operating System (discontinued mobile operating system) was also developed using C++.</p>
<p>Most of the embedded systems also powered by C. They’re mainly programmed within the C language, thanks to the language’s options of flexibility, efficient memory management, real-time performance, and closeness to the metal (hardware).</p>
<p>C++ is still dominant in gaming industry which is bigger than the film Industry. Many of the biggest and popular games and game engines are written in C/C++.</p>

</div>

<div class="beauty">
<h3> Are many developers still using C++?</h3>
<p>Many higher level programming languages allow developers to be more productive than with C for different kinds of projects.</p>
<p>However, there are lots of reason why C/C++ is still being used by many developers and will remain active for a long time. Such programming has less visibility than that occupied by many other programming languages. C++ programmers and employers tend to be a relatively closed group that the rest of the world does not see much.</p>
<p>C is the most portable and efficient language because it is as close to machine language as possible. C has a very small run time and memory footprint for its code is smaller than for most other languages.</p>
<p>Low level memory management and pointers make it perfect choice for system programming and writing Operating Systems.</p>
